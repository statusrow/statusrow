        <p>Three women with no prior rowing experience, powered by a belief that ordinary people can do extraordinary things, plan to become only the 2nd female trio <i>ever</i>, to attempt to row 3,000 miles across the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Meet the brave 3 office workers, whose current biggest daily challenge is crossing London at rush hour, who are taking on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/talisker-whisky-atlantic-challenge/" alt="The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge">the world's toughest row</a> - a feat fewer people have achieved than have climbed Everest or have gone into space!</p>

        <h2>Jess</h2>
        <p>Jess has broken more bones than she can count but still thinks that rowing an ocean is a great idea. A lover of all animals (even the naked molerat) and plants (even you, cactus) she is deeply committed to saving them and making this home we call Earth better for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Caroline</h2>
        <p>Caroline is known for her love of sleeping for 10 hours at a time (an ideal skill for a crew that will be rowing 24 hours a day). When she's not sleeping, you'll find her running, cycling, climbing or hiking across some form of land mass. A big believer in preserving this Earth and all its wonders, and that together, as a community, we can make a difference.</p>

        <h2>Suze</h2>
        <p>Always one for a good argument, Suze realised too late the Atlantic Rowing Challenge wasn’t a debating competition on the Queen Mary. Nevertheless, she loves a challenge; as long as it doesn’t involve exercise, confined spaces and the use of a bucket. Brought up in a nautical family, she feels drawn to the sea and passionately believes in preserving our beautiful blue planet.</p>
