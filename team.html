        <h2>Jess</h2>
        <p>Jess has broken more bones than she can count but still thinks that rowing an ocean is a great idea. A lover of all animals (even the naked molerat) and plants (even you, cactus) she is deeply committed to saving them and making this home we call Earth better for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Caroline</h2>
        <p>Caroline is known for her love of sleeping for 10 hours at a time (an ideal skill for a crew that will be rowing 24 hours a day). When she's not sleeping, you'll find her running, cycling, climbing or hiking across some form of land mass. A big beliver in preserving this Earth and all its wonders, and that together, as a community, we can make a difference.</p>
