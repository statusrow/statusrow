Wow, we were so busy doing and not writing a month ago - so now it’s two for the price of one as we catch up on what the crew and Poppy have been up to!

### Training

* August was a big one as we completed our longest training rows yet - firstly a 3 day and then a mega 5 day! It was a steep learning curve as we found out more about not only the physical demands of rowing for days on end, but the eating, washing, sleeping and general highs and lows of sharing a small space with two other people. And we also learnt about being out in gale force winds- sorry for the panicked messages Angus!
* It was a highlight of our year as we headed up the Thames from Gallions Point (City Airport) to [St Katharine Docks][skd] – passing through the Thames Barrier, by the O2 (it’s not been the millennium dome for years Jess), Greenwich and the Cutty Sark, and finally right by Tower Bridge as we headed into the docks. Simply magical! And we got to do it all in reverse 2 weeks later!
* We all finally completed our mandatory training and forms to meet the 1 September admin deadline – no excuses now!
* And it’s still the gym, the indoor rower, and the gym a lot more as we do all we can to be as fit as possible for the race start

### Events
* We headed to the National Audit Office in Victoria for Status Row versus the NAO... a ten hour row-off between the team and Susan’s colleagues. 40 lovely people signed up to the NAO team, each completing 15 min shifts as the three Status Row ladies shared the 10 hours in one hour shifts. The NAO claimed victory- but by just 5k, or 20 mins rowing, across the day – and congrats to Laura and Jonny for
being the individual winners.
* [St Katharine Docks][skd] hosted a 3 day [classic boat festival][skd] and Poppy proudly took her place between Gloriana- the Queen’s rowing barge- and a ginormous tug boat from Kent! Hundreds popped by to meet Poppy and learn about the row- and it was lovely to see so many friends and family.
* SKD was quickly followed by the Super September event at Lee Valley White Water Centre- incorporating the British Open. It was fabulous to watch the canoeing and kayaking, catch up with Sel from sponsor Rainbow Brands, and meet new friends. We even got out on the water (if only the flat stuff) as we had a brilliant session with Jess and the team from British Rafting. Maybe the next challenge....
* We popped South of the river to Zoopla Property Group for a learning lunch – ZPG are encouraging their staff to cut down on single-use plastic and take a plastic pledge. So we were delighted to share our mission, not least as it was a ZPG scheme that led Caroline and Jess, when they worked there, to take a climbing course where they met Suze!

### Fundraising and Sponsorship
* We were delighted to bring on board [Butterfield][bank] as our first silver sponsor – Butterfield are a financial services company operating around the world including Guernsey and Bermuda, home of crewmate Jess!
* Thanks to [FB Chain][partners] (they make chains!) who have signed up as a small business sponsor
* A big shout out to everyone at the NAO, St Katharine Docks and Super September at Lee Valley for taking part in our competitions and generously donating over £1500! You’re all fabulous.
* [Unwrpd][unwrpd] offer a sustainable subscription service to help people make less waste, they stock plastic free alternatives to everyday items and will be supplying the team with an array of ocean friendly products for the crossing.
* And we must mention ground crew command wonder Lisa Rodda who saved us a fortune by lending us​ her truck for over two weeks for towing Poppy around... Our team is so much wider than the three crew.

### Press and Social Media
* We made it to the small screen as Tom from [BBC Look East][press] headed out to Burnham for a spin on the Crouch with us. Being introduced by Stuart White is a life highlight for Susan.
* We were featured in the Marine Conservation Society magazine – we’re proud to be supporting MCS through the row and want to highlight the amazing work they do as much as we can.
* The Vurger Company featured Caroline’s story as she seeks to row the ocean fuelled by plants!
