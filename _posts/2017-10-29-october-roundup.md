October was 'packed in a lot-tober' for us as we’ve flung ourselves into our campaign to get Status Row to the start line of the world’s toughest row, whilst increasing our efforts to spread the word on plastic pollution.

We have:   

* Discovered ocean rowing is harder the second time around; getting back on the oars with Rannoch Adventure as part of their 2017 open day.
* Had our first taste of the culinary delight that is rehydrated food - apple with custard anyone?
* Joined a team of Thames21 volunteers, [clearing 40 bags of rubbish from the Thames][watlingpark] – and learning that 85% of ocean plastic originates from inland rivers
* Took our training overseas as Suze visited Dublin- and finding that the UK isn't alone in their plastic litter problems
* Launched our fabulous new 3 waves logo- all thanks to [Ronan Lachkar][ronan] who designed this sparkly new logo for us
* Attended the Ocean Film Festival where we had the pleasure of meeting Peter Kohler, the founder of [The Plastic Tide][plastictide] who are harnessing cutting edge drone and algorithm technology to create an open source map of the plastic pollution problem
* Had our story shared by the [Adventure blog][adventureblog]
* Gained our first suppliers and sponsors- thank you to [Pulsin][pulsin], [LensTec][lenstec] and [First Class Sailing][firstclasssailing] who have all come on board for the journey
* Received our first family and friends donations and [100 club][100club] members - you're all wonderful!
* Passed 300 twitter followers!
* Produced our glossy partnership brochure setting out opportunities for corporate sponsorship- [click here to download][pdf]!
* Had our first interview, talking about who we are and why we are doing this crazy endeavour, with the Bermudian Royal Gazette
* Met back up with the Thames21 team at their annual celebration, recognising the amazing volunteers, some of whom had joined over 50 cleanups/ litter counts in the year
* Learnt the need to better time the statement 'no straw please' when at the bar... several straws sadly wasted by slow reaction times.
* Had a great first meeting with Ian from the Marine Conservation Society about how we might work together to generate lots of awareness and funds for their cleaner seas programme.
* Caroline started a new job, Susan delivered her work conference and Jess marketeered away as our normal lives very much carry on alongside Status Row!
* Planked, squatted, downward dogged, ran, cycled and rowed our way through the month as training started to get serious
* And found out just how exhausting life is going to be for the next 18 months!!

As we’ve talked to more and more people about what we’re doing, we’ve been greeted with plenty of “you’re mad”, “you’re crazy”, “you’re going to die”’. But what has taken me aback is the number who have said they think we’re amazing and inspiring – us? ordinary us? We know we will only deserve that if we put everything into this mission and turn it into a reality – it’s a huge responsibility not to let people down, but it drives us on! But we can’t do it alone.

There are loads of ways you can get involved:

* help crowdfund our campaign by becoming a member of the [100 club][100club],
* follow or like us on [Twitter][twitter], [Facebook][facebook] and [Instagram][instagram],
* sign up to our [mailing list][contact],
* donate some goods in kind,
* or mention us to potential corporate sponsors.

Now on to Row-vember!
