Status Row is delighted to announce that Butterfield Bank has come on board as one of our [silver corporate sponsors][sponsors]. This support will make a positive difference to our participation in this year’s Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge, bringing us one step closer to our mission. We are the only amateur female trio in this year’s Challenge, where we have also set ourselves an extra challenge - to break the world record for both men and women and cross the Atlantic in 50 days! The current records are 51 days for men and 60 for women.

The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is the premier event in ocean rowing and one of the world’s toughest endurance events; and team Status Row is very committed to not just participate in this race, but to also raise public awareness about marine plastic pollution, with our chosen charity the Marine Conservation Society.

Sadly, it is estimated 8 million tonnes of plastic – everything from plastic bottles and bags to microbeads – end up in our oceans each year. That’s a truck load of rubbish a minute. This plastic is turning up in every corner of our planet – from beaches, to uninhabited Pacific islands. It is even found trapped in Arctic ice.

Marine plastic pollution is a concern that the Butterfield Bank also share with us and we are very proud to have their support.

**Butterfield Bank says**, “Butterfield is proud to be a silver sponsor of the Status Row team who will be taking part in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge, in which 30 crews will compete to row across 3,000 miles of the Atlantic Ocean for over 50 days. The challenge they are undertaking is extremely brave and admirable, and all for a great cause. The team is raising money for the Marine Conservation Society which is focused on reducing ocean plastics and inspiring the next generation to follow suit. Their work is consistent with our own commitment at Butterfield to do our part to protect the environment; a cause about which we are extremely
passionate. We wish the team the best of luck in the race this December.”
