When the girls first got the idea in their heads that we should row across the Atlantic I was like "yeah!" Except it was swiftly followed by a "...right," an eye roll and a quickly consumed pint. I assumed this was another insane, flash in the pan idea that would fade with the next days hangover. However, unlike the ultra marathon, climbing the three peaks or swimming the English Channel we were all still talking about rowing the Atlantic three weeks later.

It was time to get on board or walk the plank (lol, boat puns).

So I watched a video. Then I watched another. Read several blogs, researched budgets and logistics and became an overnight expert on ocean row boat manufacturers. A sleepless night, six spreadsheets and a google drive later I was full blown obsessed.

__Completely obsessed.__

So I guess the real question you probably have is why? Why the hell are we doing this completely insane thing that stronger, more experienced athletes have failed at? People have died doing the Atlantic Challenge. I mean, they don’t call it a challenge for nothing. And I won’t lie to you; as crazy and exciting as rowing across an incredibly daunting endless expanse of ocean is I still wasn’t 100% committed to the idea until I learned about the charitable aspect of it.

Atlantic rowing teams have collectively raised millions of pounds for some remarkable causes. This challenge will give us a platform to raise a significant amount of funds and educate the population about the grave issues facing our oceans. Our oceans are vital to our existence. Apart from being an incredible source of wonder and beauty it’s also where we get more than 50% of the worlds’ oxygen, 16% of our diet and a wealth of minerals.

Needless to say it’s a priceless resource yet humans have been literally trashing the ocean for years. Plastic pollution is out of control and we need to do something before it’s too late. It’s not a joke or some cliche buzzword to wave off.


> _"Non omnis moriar."_  - Not all of me will die.

I literally have that tattooed across my ribs. I want to leave this world better than I found it. I want to make a contribution that will continue to have an impact long after I’m gone. And if my legacy is getting a single person to rethink buying another plastic water bottle or cleaning up even a small patch of ocean then I will consider that a roaring success. Every change for the better, no matter how small, is a step in the right direction. That’s worth it for me. It’s worth the rigorous training and the empty savings account and even worth giving up wine.

If you agree with me at all then I hope you’ll consider supporting us on this crazy adventure.
