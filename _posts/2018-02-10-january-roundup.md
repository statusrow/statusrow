Happy new year!!!! Err, ok we’re now into Feb but it’s time for our latest round up and the big news is that 2018, the year of our race, has arrived! That’s both terrifying and exciting in equal measures and has been a been a real wake up call for our campaign to get to the start line of the world’s toughest row.
So back in town after from Christmas and new year with our families, we’ve been super busy! Here’s a sample of what we’ve been up to….

## Events and News...

* Suze started 2018 with a New Year’s Day litter pick in her local countryside- litter inland is not only an eyesore but gets into rivers and flows out to sea.
* We joined other Ocean Changemakers for the 'Towards a Plastic-Free Ocean' workshop hosted by [Emily Penn][emily], ocean advocate.
* At the London Boat Show we connected with amazing suppliers from watermakers to antifoul, life rafts to rope suppliers, GPS systems to foul weather gear!
* We shared ocean rowing aspirations with the Indian Ocean rowers (rowing the Indian Ocean), Pacific Terrific (rowing the Pacific) and Grandads of the Atlantic (rowing the… yeah got this!).
* We shipped ourselves down to Portsmouth to learn as much as we could from the incredible Mary Sutherland. Mary was part of the record setting [Rannoch Women's Challenge][rwc] team who rowed the Atlantic the ‘wrong way’ from west to east (yes, we’re doing the ‘easy’ way), achieving 3 world firsts and 3 world records.
* Thanks to Lisa Rodda, Atlantic yachtswomen, we have founded the Status Row Ground Crew - as Lisa pointed out, we need help! Email us at <a href="mailto:hello@statusrow.com">hello@statusrow.com</a> if you’d like to be part of the team.
* We became public speakers with our first event talking to staff at Rehab – a creative tech agency.
* We launched our new [Status Row team video][video] – great job Jess!
* We caught up with the team at Mile End Climbing Wall discussing how they can help promote the row and going back to where it all began….

## Sponsors/Fundraising
* [Fitbit][fitbit] came on board as our training partner – so we’re all now tracking our steps, heart rate and exercise sessions, watching as our fitness levels improve.
* [Tentmeals][tentmeals] have kindly provided us with some delicious, high calorie (and vegan) adventure foods and we look forward to future collaborations.
* We got fitted for our awesome [Julbo][julbo] shades.
* [St Katherine’s Dock][skd] gave us some complementary births for our training row along the Thames.

## Training
* Caroline became the first Status Row crew member to hit the magic two hours on the rower- equivalent to one rowing shift out on the ocean- and covering over 24 km!
* Jess wasn’t far behind as she’s been hitting the gym hard, rowing late into the night… watch your back Jess! (literally as she has been way laid by a back problem – slow down!)
* Susan mayday-ed her way to her shortwave radio licence- hoping that’s one skill she’ll never use.
* We’re all learning our ports from our starboards as we get to grips with navigation – don’t want to get lost…
* We’ve received some great training advice from Guin Batten, Olympic silver medallist and ocean rowing record holder.

## Coming-Up
* We’re spreading the word on plastic pollution and Status Row at the [Sustainable Development Group meet up][meetup].
* We’re learning first aid at sea on our RYA courses and Caroline and Jess will sit their shortwave radio certificate tests- good luck ladies!
* We’re off to Pinewood for a special screening of [A Plastic Ocean][pinewood], with producer Jo Ruxton
* And it’s more miles on the rower, more weights at the gym and a lot more fundraising!
