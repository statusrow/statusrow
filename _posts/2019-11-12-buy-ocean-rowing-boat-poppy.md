We have now sold our beloved SeaSabre classic design ocean rowing boat, Poppy. Built by Justin Adkin in 2017 she has two successful Atlantic crossings under her belt and is a multi-world record holder.

SeaSabre designs are known for their lower windage for a more traditional row, and greater stability leading to a high success rate of crossings, including in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge and Great Pacific Race.

There’s no better feeling than completing an epic row across an ocean. This could be you!
