**Farmdrop says**, “Farmdrop is delighted to sponsor Status Row on their epic mission to cross the Atlantic. It’s a daring and audacious challenge to raise awareness for an environmental problem that affects all of us. Farmdrop loves to back people who are willing to take bold action in the pursuit of better and the crew immediately won us over with their dedication and commitment."

Farmdrop uses technology and transparency to rekindle the forgotten relationship between the makers and eaters of real food. "The ethical grocer delivering delicious food direct from local farmers who are paid properly. Farmers’ market quality food with supermarket convenience that brings us all one step closer to a more sustainable food system."
