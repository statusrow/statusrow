[Unwrpd][Unwrpd] offer a sustainable subscription service to help people make less waste, they stock plastic free alternatives to everyday items and will be supplying Status Row with an array of ocean friendly products, as they participate in this year’s Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge - the premier event in ocean rowing and one of the world’s toughest endurances.

Unwrpd are on a mission to make sustainable living more convenient. **Daniel Hemsley, Founder of Unwrpd says**, “We want to encourage people to make sustainable switches to environmentally friendly alternatives by making going plastic free as easy as accessible as possible. We are delighted to support Status Row in their challenge of everyday plastic as they embark on their epic journey”.

Status Row are the only amateur female trio in this year’s Challenge and will be raising public awareness about marine plastic pollution with their chosen charity the Marine Conservation Society. It is estimated 12.7 million tons of plastic – everything from plastic bottles and bags to microbeads – end up in our oceans annually. Plastic is turning up in every corner of our planet – from beaches, to uninhabited Pacific islands; it’s even found trapped in Arctic ice!

Status Row are really pleased with Unwrpd’s products and wants to thank them for all their support. The team has been using – the toothpaste, toothbrushes, deodorant, soap, soap pouch, shampoo, lip balm and cleaning sponges.

Status Row hopes others will be encouraged to make conscious choices for the planet when purchasing everyday items.
