I was rowing solo at sunrise this morning and realised that there are only (hopefully!) a few more Mid Atlantic sunrises for me to see.   Sun rise is my favourite time of day out here in the ocean - sunsets are good too but not as easy to see when you're rowing west!  The first hint of sun rise is a slight turning of black to grey at the horizon. As the sky lightens the ocean is a sea of pinks and purples, accented with greys and black- when the sun finally appears, a golden sheen radiates out across the water. Bobbing along in the choppy waters I feel like I'm in a painting by Turner.

As I watched this morning I took time to take it in and recognise just how much a privilege this 8 weeks has been. It's been tough, uncomfortable and exhausting! We are very much ready to finish- we can't wait to se our families, shower, and after a little time to relax, crack on with all the plans we've made whilst we've had so much time to think. But it's been an incredible experience ( whole 18 months) with so many highs and magical moments. Its very emotional and I think it will only all come together at the finish. I'm back on shift in 5 minutes and will be rowing my heart out so we can complete this crazy journey. I hope you'll be watching and share it with us - we wouldn't have got here without you.
