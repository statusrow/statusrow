Wow, September has been a crazy whirlwind of a month for us. September was the month we went from talking about rowing an ocean to actually planning to row across the Atlantic. Recap, that’s 3 women traveling 3,000 miles in around 50 days all to raise awareness and funds for plastic pollution and ocean clean up efforts.

So what have we done?

- Rowed a boat for the first time
- Set up our website
- Set up our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/statusrow/" target="_blank" title="Status Row on Facebook">facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/StatusRow" target="_blank" title="Status Row on Twitter">twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/statusrow/" target="_blank" title="Status Row on Instagram">instagram</a> channels
- Visited our friends over at Rannoch Adventure who introduced us to real ocean rowing boats and the exciting (and terrifying) realities of entering the race
- Told our friends
- Told our families!
- Opened a bank account for the team (so you lovely birds can <a href="/support">help us with our campaign</a>)
- Attended a screening of <a href="http://news.sky.com/feature/sky-ocean-rescue-a-plastic-whale-10917187" target="_blank">'A Plastic Whale'</a> where we saw just how detrimental plastic is for our marine wildlife.
- We gave up #singleuseplastic bottles and invested (a whole 49p, bargain!) into reusable bottles
- Jess went to Bermuda to scout out local charities, tell her nonplussed father about the row and get a tan.
- Caroline & Suze took part in the <a href="/2017/09/16/thorpe-bay-beach-clean.html">#GreatBritishBeachClean</a> and spent the day collecting garbage and seeing firsthand the horrible effects of plastic pollution on our seas and shores.
- Reunited just in time to celebrate Jess turning 28.
- Realised, sadly, that we probably won’t have much time or money for partying anymore, #sadface.
- Our good friend Hugo took some killer team headshots for our application.
- Submitted our paperwork for entry into the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge (it’s the toughest row around, dontcha know!)
- Got accepted into the race! (Woop, celebrations!)

And that’s about it.. I know, what haven't we even been up to?

To think that we thought that was a busy month when we’ve already had an insanely hectic October and we’re only a few days in. (Also the reason why this blog is late to the publish, please forgive me!) I can’t wait for the end of October to share with you all the exciting things we’re working on right now.

I’ll leave you with some asks… whether you have found yourself here by chance or by one of the Status Row members bullying you into it (we love you, we promise) we ask you help us spread our mission. Be the microphone to our voices and help spread awareness of plastic pollution, ocean cleanups and our goal to cross the Atlantic. How?

Like, comment, follow, share - we’ll be constantly updating everyone on our social channels so make sure you don’t miss out on any news.
If you know any companies whose ethos align with our mission please, please, please introduce us.
If you personally would like to contribute to our campaign check out our <a href="/support">donations page</a>.

And; if you would like to get involved at a corporate level drop us a note at <a href="mailto:hello@statusrow.com">hello@statusrow.com</a> and we can discuss our sponsorship packages.

Most importantly though, <strong>rethink your plastic use</strong>. 300 Million tonnes of plastic is produced every single year and more than half of that is in the form of single use items. Say no to the straw or plastic bag, find ways to reuse things you do have and recycle whenever possible.

Many thanks!
