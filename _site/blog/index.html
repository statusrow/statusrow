      <p>Millions are flushing plastic cotton buds down the toilet. It’s time to stop.</p>

        Flushed down our toilets, plastic cotton bud sticks are entering the sewage system, littering our beaches and finding their way to marine environments. Once there, the sticks are ingested by marine wildlife, killing them and raising questions around the safety of our food. Yet here in the UK, millions of...

        Is there anything better than a lazy day inside on a rainy Saturday? A few weeks ago I probably would have said no but that was before I spent the day with some wonderful people clearing up litter in Watling Park in Burnt Oak. I know what you’re thinking -...

        It’s a conundrum that faces me everyday in my professional life as a Change Director and one which is at the heart our mission as Status Row. Most of us don’t like doing things differently, and especially where different seems more difficult. As a busy person who lives on her...

        Wow, September has been a crazy whirlwind of a month for us. September was the month we went from talking about rowing an ocean to actually planning to row across the Atlantic. Recap, that’s 3 women traveling 3,000 miles in around 50 days all to raise awareness and funds for...

        For me it started in a bar in Pucon, Chile; a small town at the foot of a rather large, active volcano. Of course life is full of beginnings, endings, twists and turns that change us, but that evening seems pivotal in turning me from a rather cautious, sensible soul...

        Plastic cotton buds are taking over our beaches and making their way into the ocean. Brilliant volunteers are helping to clean up the mess we’ve made, but more action is needed to prevent plastic and other litter from reaching our beaches in the first place. Documenting each piece of litter...

        It all started with the Coxless Crew documentary; A group of women, rowing the South Pacific Ocean to support women that have had to face adversity and overcome life changing events. I’d never even heard of ocean rowing before and was blown away by the incredible mental and physical challenge...

        When the girls first got the idea in their heads that we should row across the Atlantic I was like “yeah!” Except it was swiftly followed by a “…right,” an eye roll and a quickly consumed pint. I assumed this was another insane, flash in the pan idea that would...
