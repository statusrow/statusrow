            Plastic carrier bags are unsightly, terrible for our wildlife, use up finite natural resources to manufacture and take years to decompose. It wasn’t until the government stepped in that we really started to question our need for such a ‘convenient’ item. The good news is that alternatives are plentiful, cheap,...
