        <p>We're working hard to reach our target of over £100,000 in support for our charities, but we're faced with costs of over £80,000 just to get to the start line.</p>
        <p>For <a href="/mission">our mission</a> to be realised, we need to fund a boat, technical and life-saving equipment, on-shore support, food and other operational costs. There's a big list!</p>
        <p>It's a huge target that we can only achieve through a combination of the team's savings, corporate sponsorship (our support-oars) and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/100-club">the 100 club</a>.</p>
        <p>After the race, we'll be selling the boat and technical equipment to recoup some of the costs. All the money recouped from the sale will be split between our charities.</p>
        <p>Every penny spent getting to the start line helps to maximise the amount that goes to charity, but if donating money isn't for you don't worry! There are many other ways you can help.</p>
        <p>We've got a huge kit list that needs to be fulfilled before we start - from a stanley knife to a life raft, there's items big and small. If you could donate any of the items on the list this goes a long way to helping us reduce our £80,000 budget.</p>
