        <h2>Clean up the ocean</h2>
        <p>It starts at the source with education and recycling. Even a tiny, seemingly insignificant change to your everyday habits can make the world of a difference. Refuse that straw, reduce your reliance on plastic bags (carry a trendy tote), reuse your water bottle and recycle the rest. In conjunction with cleanup efforts we can leave our oceans in a better state than we inherited them.</p>
        <p><strong>Refuse. Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.</strong></p>
       <h2>Row across the Atlantic</h2>
        <p>We've got an ocean to cross. As incredible of an adventure this is and as truly wonderous the Atlantic will be there is no denying the inherent dangers and challenges of this row. By commiting ourselves to safety and preperations we <strong>will</strong> make it across, and in record time too!</p>
        <h2>Inspire the next generation</h2>
        <p>Over the past 50 years we have unfortunately seen our marine environments damaged beyond belief. But one generations actions can reverse that. By commiting to this challenge we, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/team">three women of varying vintages</a>, hope to inspire every person to push beyond their percieved limitations. You are your only obstacle and you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. You are never too young, old or late to follow your dreams.</p>
